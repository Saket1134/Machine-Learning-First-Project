# Machine-Learning-First-Project based on Logistic Regression
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict student placement (a binary outcome: placed 1 or not placed 0) based on two input features: CGPA and IQ. The model used is Logistic Regression.        
**Key Steps in the Workflow**  
The notebook follows a standard sequence for an ML project:  
1)Preprocess, EDA, and Feature Selection  
2)Extract input and output columns  
3)Scale the values   
4)Train-test split   
5)Train the model  
6)Evaluate the model   
7)Deploy the model
